# RAG-based Question Answering System

This repository demonstrates the use of **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** for answering questions using a combination of **retriever** and **language model (LLM)**. 
The system leverages a vector store (e.g., Chroma), a retriever, and a pre-trained language model to generate accurate and contextually relevant 
answers from a collection of documents.
